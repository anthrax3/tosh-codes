My pseudonyme is Tosh (or t00sh, t0x0sh).

I am a french computer sciences student, interested by hacking since many years.

I love low level hacking and digging into programs memory to find bugs. I also enjoy a lot cryptography but I'm poorly skilled on that field.

To say some words about my phylosophy, for me the two most important things to protect are Knowledge and Liberty. Also, in my opinion we must be careful about the technology and don't put all our lives on, mostly because computers have bugs and can't be 100% secured.

I know some programming languages but my favorites are C, Perl, Assembly and Bash.

I am a Linux user since 2000's.
