My pseudonyme is Tosh (or t00sh/t0x0sh) and I am a french computer sciences student, interested by hacking since many years.

I love low level hacking and digging into programs memory to find bugs. I also enjoy a lot cryptography but I'm poorly skilled on that field.

My favorites languages are C, Perl, Python, Assembly and Bash.

I am a Linux user since a long time.
