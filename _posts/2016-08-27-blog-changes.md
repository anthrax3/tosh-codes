The blog use now [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator written in Ruby. I choose Jekyll because it permits to write your blog posts with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) like [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com) which made the migration easier.

If you encounter problems while browsing the new blog, let me now !
